# Hi, I'm Eva

I'm a high school student whoâ€™s really into computer science, competitive programming, and math. I like building tools that are actually useful, teaching programming to kids, and organizing CS events for my school.

I'm also the incoming president of our school's CS Club, where we run tracks for both beginners and competitive coders (USACO + UIL).
